Conflict Resolution

* What will your team do if one person is pulling all the weight while the other person is not contributing?
Talk about it, do regular checkin to be sure we are delegating properly.

* What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other member contribute?
Talk about it, get clear on why the person feels it is nessicary to take the reigns, ask for a mediater if needed.

* How will you approach each other and the challenge of building an application knowing that it is impossible for two people to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
We will be patience, incorporate time to explain or ask question, and be flexible with how we create solutions for our differnce, and take joy in each others journey.
